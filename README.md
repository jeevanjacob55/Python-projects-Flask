# 🐍 Flask Projects Collection

---

Welcome to my curated collection of Flask-based projects! This repository is a personal archive where I experiment, build, and showcase various web applications built using the Flask microframework in Python. These projects are created to deepen my understanding of backend development, API integrations, templating with Jinja2, and full-stack workflow.
